        <h2>About ReTale</h2>
        <p>
          ReTale is a secondhand book marketplace dedicated to giving preloved books a new home. 
          We believe that every book carries stories beyond its pages â€” from the words inside 
          to the journey it has taken with its previous owners. Our mission is to make reading 
          accessible, affordable, and sustainable for everyone.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2025, ReTale started with a simple idea: to connect book lovers through 
          the power of sharing. What began as a small community of readers exchanging their 
          collections has grown into a trusted platform where thousands of books have found 
          their second owners. Today, ReTale continues to inspire a culture of reading while 
          supporting sustainability by reducing book waste.
